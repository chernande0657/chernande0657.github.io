### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part was my favorite because in the lab we made an animation
    using only our terminal with loops. This showed me just how strong
    and powerful c++ can be. It helped me realize that this is what I want
    to do after college since it gave me a feeling of pride to be able
    to say that I was able to make that with the help of my lab partner.

* Lab 3

    I really liked Lab 3 part 3 where we made a hilo game because I want to
    get into game development so this was a nice start for me to start
    making games. Even though it was something simple, I like to look at it
    like stepping stones. To me this is where my journey to game design starts.

* Lab 12

    My third favorite would have to be lab 12 part 2 where we made an animation
    using RGB and put text on the screen because it showed me the power of C++
    and why so many people use it. It made me feel really proud of myself to
    be able to say that I made that in class. So far one of my favorite things
    about Computer Science is how it gives me a feeling of happiness to say
    that I was able to solve a problem on my own or with my partners.
